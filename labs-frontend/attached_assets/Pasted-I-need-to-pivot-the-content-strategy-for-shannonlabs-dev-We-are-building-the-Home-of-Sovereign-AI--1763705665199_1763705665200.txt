I need to pivot the content strategy for shannonlabs.dev. We are building the "Home of Sovereign AI."

The design must remain "Bell Labs Brutalist" (High signal, monochromatic, academic), but the content needs to be updated with specific technical breakthroughs and the "Sovereign" thesis.

Here is the new content map. Please implement this structure:

1. THE HERO SECTION: "THE TRANSISTOR MOMENT"
   - Subhead: "Independent Discovery of Entropy Stabilization (SCU)."
   - The Timeline Visual (Keep this): Sept 02 (My Patent) vs Nov 19 (Tencent EntroPIC).
   - Add a Badge/Tag: "Status: Operating / Validated."

2. THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (The 4 Pillars of Sovereignty):
   - Use a grid layout. Each card represents a biological function of the Sovereign AI.

   [Card 1: THE BODY - SCU]
   - "Shannon Control Unit"
   - Tech: Closed-loop PI Control for Entropy Stabilization.
   - Insight: "Static schedules are vacuum tubes. This is the transistor."
   - Validation: "Prov. Patent 63/868,930."

   [Card 2: THE MIND - HEGELION]
   - "Dialectical Reasoning Engine"
   - Tech: Recursive Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis.
   - Insight: "Moving beyond next-token prediction to structural reasoning."

   [Card 3: THE SENSES - DRIFTLOCK]
   - "Compression-Based Anomaly Detection"
   - Tech: Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) without training data.
   - Insight: "Detecting drift to understand the outlier, not just quash it."

   [Card 4: THE VOICE - DRIFTLOCK CHOIR] (***UPDATED SPECS***)
   - "Chronometric Interferometry"
   - Tech: Wireless timing synchronization via 'Missing Fundamental' harmonic tuning.
   - Performance: ~90 Femtosecond Precision (Fiber speeds, wirelessly).
   - Legacy: "Advancing Ralph Bown's 'System for Transmitting Intelligence' (Bell Labs)."

3. THE MANIFESTO SECTION: "CODIFYING SOVEREIGNTY"
   - Use a serif font (like a legal filing).
   - Text:
     "We are approaching the convergence of International Law and Control Theory.
     In law school, we study the 'Reasonable Person Standard.' But as we march toward AGI, the legal definition of 'Reasonable' will not be written in court rulings, but in weight updates.
     We are building the architecture for Sovereign AI: Entities that are self-stabilizing (SCU), self-reasoning (Hegelion), and self-synchronizing (Choir).
     I am an anomaly building an anomaly detector. This is an open invitation to the future."

   - "Shannon Labs: The Anomaly Detector."
   - Links: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn.
   - "Est. 2025. Dallas, TX."

DESIGN NOTES:
- The "Choir" section needs to look dangerous. 90 femtoseconds is nearly light-speed sync. Make that metric stand out.
- Keep the vibe purely "Research Lab." No marketing fluff.
