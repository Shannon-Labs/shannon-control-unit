I need to refine the content and layout to make this a "Strategic Roadmap" rather than just a portfolio.

DESIGN TWEAKS:
1. REMOVE THE SPLIT-SCREEN HERO: You are right, the side-by-side "Patent vs Paper" is too aggressive.
   - New Hero: Just the headline "SHANNON LABS" in massive, brutalist serif font.
   - Subhead: "The Architecture of Sovereign AI."
   - A single line of monospace data below: "Est. 2025 | Dallas, TX | Status: Operating."

2. UPDATE THE "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE" GRID (The 4 Pillars):
   - We need active links and specific "Next Steps" for each.
   - Make the cards clickable to the repos/sites.

   [Card 1: THE BODY - SCU]
   - Title: SHANNON CONTROL UNIT
   - Link: https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/shannon-control-unit
   - Text: "Entropy Stabilization via Closed-Loop PI Control. Validated at 1B/3B scales. Priority Date: Sept 02, 2025."

   [Card 2: THE MIND - HEGELION]
   - Title: HEGELION
   - Link: https://github.com/Hmbown/Hegelion
   - Text: "Dialectical Reasoning Engine. Recursive Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis. Structuring thought beyond prediction."

   [Card 3: THE SENSES - DRIFTLOCK]
   - Title: DRIFTLOCK
   - Link: https://driftlock.net
   - Text: "Compression-Based Anomaly Detection. Understanding data drift via entropy deltas. Deterministic and training-free."

   [Card 4: THE VOICE - DRIFTLOCK CHOIR] (***CRITICAL UPDATE***)
   - Title: DRIFTLOCK CHOIR
   - Link: https://github.com/Hmbown/DRIFTLOCKCHOIR
   - Text: "Chronometric Interferometry. Wireless sync at ~90fs precision. The goal: Validating this hardware layer at scale (Fort Mason)."

3. THE MANIFESTO SECTION (The Narrative):
   - Title: "THE RENAISSANCE PROTOCOL"
   - Use a clean Serif font (editorial style).
   - Content to insert (Use this exact text):
     "I am a current 2L at SMU Law and an MBA, but these ideas are moving faster than the semester.
     I am building the 'Patent-Attorney-Inventor-Musician' profile—a Renaissance approach for the AGI era.
     I have three commercially viable software architectures (SCU, Driftlock, Hegelion) and one massive hardware research thesis (Choir).
     My immediate goal: To validate Chronometric Interferometry on the bench. I need to be around builders who think at this frequency.
     I am not leaving the law; I am informing it. But the Inventor leg of the stool needs a lab. The ideas aren't stopping, and neither am I."

4. FOOTER:
   - "Shannon Labs."
   - "Built for the Sovereign Era."
   - Links: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn.

TECH NOTES:
- Ensure the GitHub links open in new tabs.
- The design should still feel "Academic" and "High Signal"—lots of whitespace, strong lines, no fluff.
