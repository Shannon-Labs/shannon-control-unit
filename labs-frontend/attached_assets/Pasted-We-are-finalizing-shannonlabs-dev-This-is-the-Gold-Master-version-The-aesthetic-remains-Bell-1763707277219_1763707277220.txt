We are finalizing shannonlabs.dev. This is the "Gold Master" version.



The aesthetic remains "Bell Labs Brutalist" (High signal, academic, monochromatic), but we need to elevate the narrative to honor the founder's legacy.



CORE CHANGE:

This is no longer just a personal site. It is the digital home of "Shannon Labs," built on the principles of Ralph Bown (Director of Research, Bell Labs, 1952).



STRUCTURE & CONTENT UPDATES:



1. HERO SECTION: "THE ARCHITECTURE OF SOVEREIGN AI"

   - Headline: SHANNON LABS.

   - Subhead: "The Architecture of Sovereign AI."

   - Metadata line: "Est. 2025 | Dallas, TX | Operating under the Bown Principles."



2. NEW SECTION: "THE INSTITUTIONAL DNA" (The North Star)

   - Place this immediately after the Hero.

   - Use the specific quote from Ralph Bown's 1952 speech ("Vitality of a Research Institution"):

     > "The vitality of a research organization is only a composite of the spirit of the people in it... It is the uncovering of new knowledge or the achieving of new understandings."

     > — Ralph Bown, Director of Research, Bell Labs (1952).

   - Context: "Continuing the legacy of transmitting intelligence from 1948 to 2025."



3. THE SYSTEM GRID (The 4 Pillars):

   - Keep the Grid layout, but update the "Driftlock Choir" card specifically:

   - [Card 4: DRIFTLOCK CHOIR]

     - Title: DRIFTLOCK CHOIR

     - Subtitle: "Chronometric Interferometry"

     - Text: "2025 Extension of Ralph Bown’s 1948 Patent for 'Transmitting Intelligence.' Solving 6G synchronization with ~90fs precision."

     - Action: Link to the GitHub Repo.



4. THE MANIFESTO: "THE RENAISSANCE PROTOCOL"

   - Title: "THE RENAISSANCE PROTOCOL"

   - Text:

     "I am building the 'Patent-Attorney-Inventor-Musician' profile—a Renaissance approach for the AGI era.

     I hold an MBA and am currently informing the law as a 2L, but the ideas are moving faster than the semester.

     I have three commercially viable software architectures (SCU, Driftlock, Hegelion) and one massive hardware research thesis (Choir).

     This is not a pivot; it is an evolution. I am building the lab that the 'Inventor' leg of the stool requires.

     The ideas aren't stopping, and neither am I."



5. FOOTER:

   - "Shannon Labs."



   - Links: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn.



DESIGN NOTES:

- Remove "JD Candidate" from the main header/hero. It diminishes the "Research Lab" vibe. Keep it in the Manifesto text only.

- Ensure the typography for the Ralph Bown quote feels historical yet timeless (Serif, italicized).
