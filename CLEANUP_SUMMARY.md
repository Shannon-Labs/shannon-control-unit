- **scu_outreach/** - Launch campaign materials
- **docs_reports/** - Development reports
- **PUBLICATION_SUMMARY.md** - Early publication planning
- **REPO_GUIDELINES.md** - Draft guidelines
- **huggingface_model_card.md** - Model card iterations

## 🏗️ New Structure Created

## 🎯 Repository Now Optimized For

### Immediate Impact
- **Researchers**: Clear API docs, validation results, technical deep-dives
- **Practitioners**: Examples, quick start, training scripts
- **Investors**: Professional presentation, proven metrics
- **Contributors**: Guidelines, roadmap, issue templates

### Next Phase Evolution
- External validation partnerships (7B+ models)
- Academic publication pipeline
- Community contributions
- Commercial deployment

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Cleanup
- 🔴 Scattered documentation across multiple locations
- 🔴 Historical planning docs mixed with production code
- 🔴 Duplicate assets and legacy code
- 🔴 No clear contributor onboarding
- 🔴 Mixed phases of development

### After Cleanup
- ✅ Clear documentation hierarchy
- ✅ Professional project structure
- ✅ Clean separation of current vs historical
- ✅ Comprehensive contributor guidelines
- ✅ Investor-ready presentation
- ✅ Academic-ready technical docs

## 🚀 Ready for Next Phase

The repository now embodies Marie Kondo principles:
1. **Everything has a place** - Clear directory structure
2. **Purpose-driven** - Each file serves current mission
3. **Joy-sparking** - Professional, clean, inspiring
